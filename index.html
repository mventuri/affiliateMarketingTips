			<h1>My story as an affiliate marketer</h1>
			<p>After years of study, in 2013 I decided it was time for me to start my journey to become an affiliate marketer. </p>
			<p>Wow. It all sounds very powerful and easy but my very first question was: where do I get started? I got my certificates, 
			I studied hard and I passed exams. However, everybody knows an excellent theorical knowledge is mandatory to succeed but you have to test - and
			improve - your skills in everyday life.</p>
			<p>I did - and I am still doing - it. Anyway I created this page to share with you my experience and path. I'll just describe basic tips to start. I hope you'll find it useful!</p>
		  </div>

		<div id="beginning" class="row">
		  <div class="col-xs-12">
			<h1>Kick-off: what do you sell?</h1>
			<p>This is the very first question I asked myself. Finding a good answer is much harder than you think. I surfed the internet for months trying
			to find a good and profitable niche. I did it and you can do it as well. There are just a few questions, and right answers, you must find.</p>
			<h3> What do you like?</h3>
			<p>When you sell - online or offline - you need to know your products and niches. Why? Becuase you're going to talk about it <strong>a lot!</strong>Where? When? We'll see that in next steps.</p>
			<p>It can be anything: a hobby, what you studied, your job. But you must be an expert of that field.</p>
			<p>Good. Let's start thinking about a niche you can handle: write down <strong>at least three topics you master.</strong></p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-12 list">
			<h3>Your topics:</h3>
				<table class="col-xs-12 items">
					<thead>
						<tr>
						<th class="col-xs-12 edit" colspan="3"><span>edit</span></th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
					</tbody>

			<h3> You're not alone</h3>
			<p>Micheal Jackson was right. The world's full of people and... They probably have different interests than you!</p>
			<p>I know what you're thinking. I am not telling you to trash your list and go away. I just want you to know <strong>you also need to find an interested audience</strong>
			to talk to! <strong>You must build your audience since the beginning!</strong> You have to know what people search online and how often. How? The internet is full of tools to get it. The most famous - and my favorite - one is <a target="_blank" href="https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner?hl=it">Google Keyword Planner</a>.</p>
			<h3>Is it big enough or... Too big?</h3>
			<p>Ok. This is the toughest point of this stage. You understood what you like and you also know a lot of people like it as well. I guess you're  aware of the fact
			thousands of people sell stuff online. They're your competitors.</p>
			<p>At this stage you need to understand if there's too much competition in your niche or if the niche you chose is too small and your business won't be scalable.</p>
			<p>I mean... It's better if you don't join a niche where big and famous websites invest millions of dollars nor niches followed by very few people. You need to find the
			<strong>correct balance between competition and audience volume</strong>. How? It is up to you. Don't forget you're an <strong>enterpreneur</strong> and you're supposed to take risks!</p>

				<h1>Even world's best painter needs a brush to get famous!</h1>
				<p>You're a master of your niche and you know there are enough people to create an audience. Awesome! Wait... How do you get known?!</p>
				<h3>Write, Write and... Write!</h3>
				<p>The best way to share your knowledge is writing about it. And the best way to write about your topic on the internet is running a blog!</br>
				Aren't you a coder? Don't you know how to build a page? Not a big trouble. You can use a Content Management System to run your blog! There are plenty
				of them online. Anyway, I suggest you to join the <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> community. It's easy to use and thousands of developers worldwide work on it. Furthermore,
				if you need support, you can get my <a href="mailto:mventuri@hotmail.it">help</a>! ;)</p>
				<h3>Advertise!</h3>
				<p>If people doesn't find you, you need to find them! Invest some money - believe me if I tell you big budgets are not necessary - on Facebook Ads,
				Google ads, Bing ads and so on. You can reach people worldwide and make great profits!</p>
				<h3>Emails!</h3>
				<p>I want to be clear. Don't spam. It bothers you the same way bothers anybody. <strong>Build your list</strong> and provide your audience with reliable 
				and high quality content. They must be happy to see your message in their mailbox! Share your experience and knowledge with them!</p>

				<h1>Where do you find your products</h1>
					<p>Great. You found a niche and you found a way - or several ones - to sell your products. There's now one more step to face:
					where do you find good products and, first of all, <strong>reliable suppliers</strong> to work with? You can find on the internet
					hundreds of platforms where you can deal with suppliers. They're basically intermediaries between you, the publisher, and the supplier, the merchant. You'll
					find marketing tools and a commission management system. I worked with several partners such as <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/welcome">Amazon</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tradedoubler.com">Tradedoubler</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zanox.com">Zanox</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://site.clickpoint.com">Clickpoint</a>.
					Have a look at their websites.</p>
